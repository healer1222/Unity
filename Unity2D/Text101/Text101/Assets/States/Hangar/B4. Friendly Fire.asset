  storyText: "B4. Friendly Fire\r\nYou tear off a piece of metal framing from your
    leather airship pilot armour and hold it ready as a shiv of sorts. As the door
    opens you rush at your captor, leaping like a crazy person and hollering a primal
    scream of rage.\r\n\r\nPayback time for your beating and from all the pain these
    dirty Festers have caused your family. You drive home your metal shiv. You hear
    the crunch of bones and feel the slice of flesh. \r\n\r\nAfter a brief struggle,
    there is stillness. You look down and see... oh my lord... you see... yourself?
    What? How?\r\n\r\n1. Continue..."
