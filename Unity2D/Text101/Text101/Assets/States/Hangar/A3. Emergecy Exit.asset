  storyText: "A3. Emergency Exit\r\nOkay, you're around the corner. No one can see
    you. You think.\r\n\r\nBit tough to hear yourself think above the thumping machinery.
    However, in front of you is the emergency exit door. It has an oversized, cast
    iron lock hanging from a bolted handle. You could try picking the lock, or maybe
    look for a way to pry it off.\r\n\r\nWhat to do?\r\n\r\n1. Pick it.\r\n2. Pry
    it."
